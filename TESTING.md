## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Run 'make test' to run all unit tests.

- Always use credentials 'test@example.com' and password 'test' for testing in the browser.
- Run 'make run-backend' to start the backend in development mode. If it fails with 'address already in use' - assume that the backend is already running.
- Run 'make run-frontend' to start the frontend in development mode. If it fails with 'Port 4200 is already in use' - assume that the frontend is already running.
